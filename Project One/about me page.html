        <p class="bio_1" >I am a senior working towards my BFA of graphic  <br> design at Massachusetts College of Art and Design. <br> I am originally from New York, but am currently <br> living in Boston, MA. I love print  and UX/UI design, <br> and always try to translate my love for stories and <br> making a difference into my work. I have interned <br> at Boston Magazine, and am currently interning at <br> Small Army, both located in Boston, MA. </p> 

        <p class="bio_2">On the rare occasions that I am not behind my laptop <br> screen you might find me reading a good book, <br>  crocheting a warm blanket, or binging new episodes <br> of 'Ellen' or 'Shark Tank.' Be sure to check me out on <br>  LinkedIn as well!
