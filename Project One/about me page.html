        <h1>Let me introduce myself...</h1>

        <p>I am a senior working towards my BFA of graphic design at Massachusetts College of Art and Design. I am originally from New York, but am currently living in Boston, MA. I love print and UX/UI design, and always try to translate my love for stories and making a difference into my work.
