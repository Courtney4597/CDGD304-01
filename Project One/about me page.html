        <p >I am a senior working towards my BFA of graphic design at <br>Massachusetts College of Art and Design. I am originally from <br> New York, but am currently living in Boston, MA. I love print  and <br> UX/UI design, and always try to translate my love for stories <br> and making a difference into my work. I have interned at Boston<br> Magazine, and am currently interning at Small Army, both <br>located in Boston, MA. </p>

        <p >On the rare occasions that I am not behind my computer <br> screen you might find me reading a good book, crocheting <br>a warm blanket, or binging new episodes of Ellen.
