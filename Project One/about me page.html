            <h1>Let me introduce myself...</h1>

            <p>I am a senior working towards my BFA of graphic design at <br>Massachusetts College of Art and Design. I am originally from <br> New York, but am currently living in Boston, MA. I love print  and <br> UX/UI design, and always try to translate my love for stories and making <br> a difference into my work. I have interned at Boston Magazine,<br> and am currently interning at Small Army, both located in Boston, MA. </p>
                
            <p>On the rare occasions that I am not behind my computer screen you might<br> find me reading a good book, crocheting a warm blanket, or binging new episodes of Ellen.
